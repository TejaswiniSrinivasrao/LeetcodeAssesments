You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.


Solution:

var countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    let finalCount = 0;
    let charObj;
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        // Loop to get the length of array to find number of characters
        charObj = makeCharObj(chars);
        //calling makeCharobj function by passing the chars available
        for (let j = 0; j < words[i].length; j++) {
        // Loop to get the length of each word
            let char = words[i][j];
           // conditon to check if at the end of the word length  and charObj has the value or not 
            if (j == words[i].length - 1 && charObj[char]) {
                finalCount += words[i].length;
            } else if (charObj[char]) {
                charObj[char]--;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return finalCount;
};

var makeCharObj = (chars) => {
    let charObj = {};
    //looping through the available characters
    for (let char of chars) {
        // checking for character if it is there then add 1 else assigning 1 to char array to count
        charObj[char] ? charObj[char] += 1 : charObj[char] = 1;
        
    }
    return charObj;
    
}
